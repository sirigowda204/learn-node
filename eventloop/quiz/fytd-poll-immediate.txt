- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

1. Order of Execution:

The file read operation is initiated.
Once completed, its callback executes, followed by the scheduling of setImmediate() and setTimeout() callbacks.
The setImmediate() callback runs immediately.
The setTimeout() callback, with a very short delay, runs shortly after.

2. Effect of Changing Timeout to 0ms:

The order of execution remains similar because the timeout callback is still scheduled immediately after the file read callback. 
However, its actual execution might be slightly delayed by other tasks in the event loop.

- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?


1. Order of Execution:

someAsyncOperation() is called, initiating a file read operation, and setTimeout() schedules a callback after 100 milliseconds.
The event loop waits during the Poll Phase.
Once the file read completes, its callback is queued.
The event loop then checks for expired timers and finds the timeout callback, queuing it as well.
The callbacks are executed, first the file read callback, then the timeout callback.

2. Effect of Changing Delay in While Loop (10ms to 150ms):
The order of execution remains similar, but the overall program execution time increases due to the longer delay in the while loop.

3. Effect of Changing Timeout to 0ms:
The timeout callback is queued almost immediately after setTimeout() is called.
However, due to the while loop delay in the file read callback, it's likely to execute first, so the order may remain the same.

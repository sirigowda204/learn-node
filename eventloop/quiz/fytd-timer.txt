- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.


First, foo(2) is called, which logs 'foo', schedules bar(2) to be executed, and logs 'baz'. 
Then, foo(1) is called, repeating the same steps for bar(1). 
Finally, the callback queue triggers, executing bar(2) followed by bar(1). 

The output is:
foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar

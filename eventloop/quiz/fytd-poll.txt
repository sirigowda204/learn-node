- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The code first calls someAsyncOperation(), initiating a file read operation. 
Then, foo() is called, followed by console.log('done'). 
Meanwhile, the event loop waits for the file read to complete. 
Once it's done, the corresponding callback function executes, logging either the data read or an error message. 

Here's the sequence:

someAsyncOperation()
foo()
console.log('done')
[File read completes]
[Callback function executes]
